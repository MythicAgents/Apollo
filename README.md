![Apollo](documentation-payload/apollo/ApolloLandscape.svg)

Apollo is a Windows agent written in C# using the 4.0 .NET Framework designed to be used in SpecterOps training offerings.

## Installation
To install Apollo, you'll need Mythic installed on a remote computer. You can find installation instructions for Mythic at the [Mythic project page](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic/).

From the Mythic install directory, use the following command to install Apollo as the **root** user:

```
./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo.git
```

From the Mythic install directory, use the following command to install Apollo as a **non-root** user:

```
sudo -E ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo.git
```

Once installed, restart Mythic to build a new agent.

## Commands Manual Quick Reference

Command | Syntax                                                                                                                | Description

## Supported C2 Profiles

### [HTTP Profile](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http)

The HTTP profile calls back to the Mythic server over the basic, non-dynamic profile. When selecting options to be stamped into Apollo at compile time, all options are respected with the exception of those parameters relating to GET requests.

### [HTTPX Profile](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/httpx)

Advanced HTTP profile with malleable configuration support and message transforms. Provides significantly more flexibility and OPSEC benefits compared to the basic HTTP profile, making it ideal for red team operations.

### [SMB Profile](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/smb)

Establish communications over SMB named pipes. By default, the named pipe name will be a randomly generated GUID.

### [TCP Profile](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/tcp)

Establish communications over a specified network socket. Note: If unelevated, the user may receive a prompt to allow communications from the binary to occur over the network.

### [WebSocket Profile](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/websocket)

Establish communications over WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication.

## SOCKSv5 Support

Apollo can route SOCKS traffic regardless of what other commands are compiled in. To start the socks server, issue `socks -Port [port]`. This starts a SOCKS server on the Mythic server which is `proxychains4` compatible. To stop the SOCKS proxy, navigate to the SOCKS page in the Mythic UI and terminate it.

## Quality of Life Improvements

### File Triage

The `ls` command reports back a wealth of information and allows operators to easily copy file paths and examine permissions of files, in addition to being able to sort and filter files. Clicking the icon under the ACLs column will show all the permissions of a file. Additionally, this hooks into Mythic's native file browser.

This shows typical ls output:
![ls browserscript](documentation-payload/apollo/commands/images/ls02.png)

Interfaces with Mythic's filebrowser and caches data server-side:
![ls mythic builtin](documentation-payload/apollo/commands/images/filebrowser.png)

### Process Listings

When issuing `ps`, additional details are retrieved such as:
- Company name of the process executable
- Description of the process executable
- Full path of the process
- Integrity level of the process
- Desktop session
- Process command line arguments

This process listing also interfaces with Mythic's builtin process browser, which allows you to see process trees more easily.

Lastly, the associated browser script will do row highlighting based on the process's name (in a one-to-one port of [this script](https://github.com/harleyQu1nn/AggressorScripts/blob/master/ProcessColor.cna))

### Portable Executable, Assembly, and PowerShell Script Caching

Apollo can cache files for expeditious task execution. In general, control flow follows the `register_file` command followed by whatever command you wish to execute (`execute_assembly`, `powerpick`, `execute_pe`, etc.). These files are cached client side via DPAPI encrypted AES256 blobs, preventing their signatures being exposed outside of task execution.

### Dynamic Injection Techniques

The agent can change what code injection technique is in use by post-exploitation jobs that require injection through a suite of injection commands. Currently, injection techniques that are supported:

- CreateRemoteThread
- QueueUserAPC (Early Bird)

### Job Tracking

Agent jobs are tracked by job ID, by command, and by the arguments passed to the command so that you know what job correlates to what tasking.

### Artifact Tracking

Commands that manipulate the disk, create new logons, or spawn new processes will document those changes in the Artifact Reporting page as shown below.

### And more!

There's a number of niceities that come with pairing an agent to Mythic - too many to list in one README. Install the agent and see for yourself!
