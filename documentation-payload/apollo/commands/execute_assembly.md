## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- T1547

## Detailed Summary
The `execute_assembly` command uses a .NET Common Language Runtime loader to execute assemblies within a sacrificial process and return output over a named pipe back to the agent. This loader is injected into a sacrificial process (specified by the `spawnto_*` commands) and passes the assembly's bytes over a named pipe, which is then loaded reflectively using `System.Reflection.Assembly.Load`. This assembly is then invoked and passed any passed arguments while streaming data over the named pipe.

This creates a new artifact relating to the sacrificial process spawned, which can be viewed in the artifacts page.
