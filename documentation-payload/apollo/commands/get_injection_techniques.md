## Detailed Summary
The `get_injection_techniques` command displays the various process injection techniques the agent is capable of using for post-exploitation jobs. You can see the current technique being used by an agent with the [`get_injection_techniques`](/agents/apollo/commands/get_injection_techniques/) command. The technique can also be changed using the [`set_injection_technique`](/agents/apollo/commands/set_injection_technique/) command.

You are encouraged to create your own injection technique and submit a new pull request!

### Available techniques

#### CreateRemoteThread
"Classic" process injection technique that uses the `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory` and `CreateRemoteThread` Windows APIs to execute shellcode in a specified process.

#### Early bird QueueUserAPC
Works for all jobs spawning sacrificial processes, but mileage may vary for injection-type commands. Calls `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `QueueUserAPC` and `ResumeThread` calls.
